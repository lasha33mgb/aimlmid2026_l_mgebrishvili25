Task 1
Finding the Correlation (Pearson) 
The dataset was obtained from an interactive online graph, where each blue point represents a data observation.
The coordinate values were manually extracted by inspecting the graph and noting the displayed values.

After collecting the data, Pearson's correlation coefficient was computed using Python with the NumPy library.
To support the numerical analysis, a scatter plot was created using Matplotlib in order to illustrate the relationship between the two variables.

The resulting correlation coefficient describes how strongly and in which direction the variables are linearly related.
This interpretation is consistent with the visual pattern observed in the scatter plot
The Pearson correlation coefficient is r = 0.45, indicating a moderate positive linear relationship between X and Y.
